Use eclipse-che to build your own sponge based plugins.

## Install
Start and install che by following the [eclipse che docs][1], then go to `Stacks` choose `Add Stack`.
Then "expand" the `Raw Configuration` by clicking on `Show` and paste the content of [stack.json][2] in, then click `Save`.
Now you can create a minecraft plugin project from the `Stack Library`
